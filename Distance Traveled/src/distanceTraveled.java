/* Instruction:
Write a program that asks the user to input the speed of a car (in miles-per-hour) and the
number of hours it has traveled. It should use a loop to display the distance a car has traveled
for each hour of a time period specified by the user.
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows‚Äù
Distance = Speed * Time
For example, if a car travels 60 miles-per-hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 180
miles.
Output:
It should display a report similar to the one that follows:
Hours Distance Traveled
--------------------------------------------
1 	60
2 	120
3 	180
Input Validation:
Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time
traveled.
