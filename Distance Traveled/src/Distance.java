 * Chapter 4 Lab Assignment 2
Distance File
Modify the program you wrote for Chapter 4 Lab Assignment 1 (Distance Traveled) so it writes
the report to a file instead of the screen. Open the file in Notepad or another text editor to
confirm the output.
*** The following program that you wrote for Chapter 4 Lab Assignment 1
Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows‚Äù
Distance = Speed * Time
Write a program that asks the user to input the speed of a car (in miles-per-hour) and the
number of hours it has traveled. It should use a loop to display the distance a car has traveled
for each hour of a time period specified by the user.
For example, if a car travels 60 miles-per-hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 180
miles. It should display a report similar to the one that follows:
Hours Distance Traveled
--------------------------------------------
1 60
2 120
3 180
Input Validation
Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time
traveled.
Submit the java source code only.
