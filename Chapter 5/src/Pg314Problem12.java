 * Tejas Pinjala Chapter 5 Pg: 314 Problem # 12
 * 
 * Instruction Kinetic Energy:
 * Write a method named kineticEnergy that accepts an objectâ€™s mass (in kilograms) and 
 * velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The method should return the amount of 
 * kinetic energy that the object has. Demonstrate the method by calling it in a program that 
 * asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.
 * 
 * KE = 1/2 mv^2
